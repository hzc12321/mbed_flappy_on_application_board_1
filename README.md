This is a remastered project based on Flappy Mbed @ https://os.mbed.com/users/jmelliadis3/notebook/flappy-mbed/
It is altered in a way that it utilises whatever component is available on a Mbed LPC1768 application board. For example, the display is changed from a uLCD-144-G2 to a 128x32 Graphics LCD due to component limitations, and due to the change in size and color of the display, the code are altered to display the game correctly.
Meanwhile, a lot more features are added to the game to make it more fun and challenging. For example, the potentiometer is used to control the flying speed of the bird which changes the difficulty of the game.
Please experience it with a LPC1768 application board. No external components required.
